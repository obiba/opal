Description: OBiBa Data integration Web application for biobanks
 Python client for Opal, OBiBa’s core database application for biobanks.
 Participant data, once collected from any data source, must be integrated and
 stored in a central data repository under a uniform model. Opal is such a central
 repository. It can import, process, validate, query, analyze, report, and export
 data. Opal is typically used in a research center to analyze the data acquired at
 assessment centres. Its ultimate purpose is to achieve seamless data-sharing
 among biobanks.
 .
 OBiBa is an international software development project committed to building a
 full suite of open source software for biobanks. It is comprised of several
 independent and self-funded teams around the world, each of which is producing
 stand-alone applications that support particular biobank activities. The
 applications can be customized and integrated to create a complete biobank
 information management system.
