Description: OBiBa Data integration Web application for biobanks
 Python client for Opal, OBiBaâ€™s core database application for biobanks.
 Participant data, once collected from any data source, must be integrated and
 stored in a central data repository under a uniform model. Opal is such a central
 repository. It can import, process, validate, query, analyze, report, and export
 data. Opal is typically used in a research center to analyze the data acquired at
 assessment centres. Its ultimate purpose is to achieve seamless data-sharing
 among biobanks.
 .
 OBiBa is an international software development project committed to building a
 full suite of open source software for biobanks. It is comprised of several
 independent and self-funded teams around the world, each of which is producing
 stand-alone applications that support particular biobank activities. The
 applications can be customized and integrated to create a complete biobank
 information management system.
