Description: OBiBa Data integration Web application for biobanks
 Opal is OBiBaâ€™s core database application for biobanks. Participant data, once
 collected from any data source, must be integrated and stored in a central
 data repository under a uniform model. Opal is such a central repository. It
 can import, process, validate, query, analyze, report, and export data. Opal
 is typically used in a research center to analyze the data acquired at
 assessment centres. Its ultimate purpose is to achieve seamless data-sharing
 among biobanks.
 .
 OBiBa is an international software development project committed to building a
 full suite of open source software for biobanks. It is comprised of several
 independent and self-funded teams around the world, each of which is producing
 stand-alone applications that support particular biobank activities. The
 applications can be customized and integrated to create a complete biobank
 information management system.
